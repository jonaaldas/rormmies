                <p class="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-center">
                    Hey, there! We‚Äôre new(ish) parents to a curious 19-month year old who loves to explore. Before having a child, we lived abroad and traveled the world for 10 years. We always knew
                    once we‚Äôd have a kid that we wanted to show her the world. But, we were in for a real surprise when she was born. The sleep deprivation and challenges of caring for a newborn while
                    managing work-from-home with no help led us to put that traveling lifestyle on the backburner, at least for a while. So, we settled for moving back abroad to Portugal so we could
                    still have a taste of the abroad life, but still have a chance to get some of our time back.
                </p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-center font-medium">
                        When we finally got our daughter into ‚Äúcreche‚Äù at 16-months old, she absolutely LOVED the routine, activities, healthy lunches, and socialization that it offered her. She‚Äôs
                        there right now!
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-center font-medium">And, it changed our lives, too.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-center font-medium">
                        So much so, that even though the travel devil on our shoulder is whispering in our ears to go out and hit the road again, the angel on the other shoulder whispers back.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-center font-medium">‚ÄúCan we really take her out of school now?‚Äù</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-center font-medium">
                        Wait. Really? How ironic. The exact 9-5 system we‚Äôve escaped becoming digital nomads is exactly what‚Äôs serving us and our child‚Äîand us‚Äîright now.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-center font-medium">
                        Let‚Äôs be real. Traveling with kids is just parenting in another city. You dream of hitting a restaurant in the middle of the day, but the playground is the only chance for you
                        to relax and your kid to play.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-center font-medium">
                        This is why having daycare available is an absolute necessity for digital nomad families with young children. They have fun and routine, you have a much-needed break to
                        actually explore the place you‚Äôre in.

                    <h3 class="mt-2 text-3xl font-semibold">üîç The Problem: Finding Short-Term & Flexible Options for 0-6</h3>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-center">
                        Sure, there are plenty of school options for traveling families, many of which we plan to take advantage of once our daughter is old enough. This is because in general,
                        daycares and preschools require a long-term commitment, as well as a transition period for them to get comfortable with the new routine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-center">So, if daycare isn‚Äôt available, parents are left making a difficult decision.</p>

                    <ul class="mt-4 list-inside text-center text-base">
                        <li>Do you pull them out?</li>
                        <li>Does one parent quit their job to take care of the child full-time?</li>
                        <li>What if that parent needs a break?</li>
                        <li>ANd, what about single parents?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-center">And, what about the child? Do they even want to be with mom and dad all day? Will traveling be even worth it if you‚Äôre constantly stressed?</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-center font-semibold">Traveling families need options.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-center">
                        The thing is,, when we started looking, we realized it‚Äôs extremely challenging to find information on schools that are not only available for children 0-6 years old, but also
                        offer short-term and flexible enrollment for digital nomad families who may want to explore a place for just a few weeks or months at a time. There are so many questions to ask
                        during this process, and that‚Äôs on top of trip planning!
                    </p>

                <p class="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-center">
                    What if we made it easier for digital nomad parents to find exactly what they need for their busy babies, active toddlers, and pre-kindys, wherever they want to go in the world?
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-center">
                    From crowdsourcing, personal recommendations, word-of-mouth, online forums, and talking to schools directly, we‚Äôre building our database from the ground up.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-center font-semibold">Best of all, our database is curated by parents, for parents.</p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-center">
                    We are making sure to vet each school and program to meet a certain set of expectations and standards that we have for our own child. And, as former teachers, we also understand
                    the other side. We find that these values are shared by many digital nomad families.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-center font-semibold">Most importantly, we‚Äôre giving you (some) of your time back.</p>

                <p class="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-center">‚úì Find schools that are open to international families, even if you don‚Äôt speak/read the local language.</p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-center">‚úì Find schools that offer short-term and flexible options for weeks or months at a time.</p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-center">‚úì Find schools that have easy sign-up options, so you can guarantee a spot for your child before booking your trip.</p>

                <p class="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-center">‚ùå We‚Äôre not including nannies or childcare options.</p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-center">‚ùåWe don‚Äôt want to disrupt the dynamic in the classroom, so the school must have minimum attendance expectations.</p>

                    ‚ùåWe‚Äôre not creating another digital nomad bubble. We are aiming to include as many LOCAL daycares as possible, so monolingual schools are not off the list. (Our daughter goes to a
                    fully-Portuguese daycare.)
